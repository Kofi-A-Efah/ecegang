      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Fighting games are rising in popularity around the globe. 
        However, a consistent barrier to new player entry has been the difficulty of the inputs. 
        Rather than pressing a single button for attacks and moves, 
        fighting games often require complex frame-perfect combinations of buttons to perform combos necessary to compete at even basic 
        levels. Many new players find that learning these combos and button strings are not worth learning, 
        and become disenchanted with fighting games early on. 
        This problem also extends to players at the highest level, 
        who may have difficulty consistently inputting the most powerful and optimal combos possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        To help solve this problem, we created a project called TKButtons. With the modified controller (Betsy) and our 
        program, you can record your combo ahead of time, and then playback during the game. The controller contains a PIC32 
        microcontroller and some circuity which allows the player to play the game through a arcade stick. When the player is ready, then 
        the player can hit the record button. The PIC32 controller then keep tracks when each button and stick input were hit and the time 
        that they were hit. To finish the recording, the player hits one of the playback buttons. To play the recording, the player 
        just needs to hit either the left or right playback button. The PIC32 will then play through the button/stick inputs that 
        were just recorded. The player can also cancel the recording and the playback whenever they want.
